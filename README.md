Single-cell and spatial transcriptional profiling of human pulmonary veins reveals an extracellular matrix-related myofibroblast subclusters associated with pulmonary vein stenosis.
Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC), especially when accompanied by pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS), represents a rare and severe form of congenital heart disease. In this investigation, we carried out a thorough analysis of the cellular heterogeneity present in pulmonary veins from healthy donors (H group), TAPVC patients without PVS (TAPVC group), and TAPVC patients experiencing PVS (PVS group) utilizing single-nucleus and spatial RNA sequencing techniques. Our study revealed distinct cellular compositions across these groups and identified a myofibroblast subcluster related to the extracellular matrix (ECM) associated with PVS. Additionally, we uncovered seven co-expression modules within myofibroblasts, including a module linked to membrane potential signaling that showed a significant correlation exclusively with the ECM-related myofibroblast subcluster. Notably, the communication of the ECM-related myofibroblast subcluster was most pronounced in the PVS group, underscoring its pivotal role in the PVS pathology. These findings offer important insights into pulmonary vein biology and lay the groundwork for developing potential therapeutic strategies for TAPVC complicated by PVS.
